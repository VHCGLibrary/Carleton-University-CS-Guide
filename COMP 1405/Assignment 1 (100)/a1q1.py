# Set x to a correct number from 1-100.
# Let the user guess the correct number.
# 	If the user's guess is > x, inform them that they should guess lower.
# 	If the user's guess is < x, inform them that they should guess higher.
#	The user must guess again.
# If the user's guess == x, inform them that they guessed correctly and the game is over.
