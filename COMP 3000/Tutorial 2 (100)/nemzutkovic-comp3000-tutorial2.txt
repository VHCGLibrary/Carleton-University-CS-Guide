COMP 3000: Tutorial 2

1. Compiled and ran 3000shell.
2. ls &: Outputs similar result to Linux shell, except with more verbosity about the process being backgrounded.
   bc &: Difficult time taking input and providing output, but possible.
   nano &: Doesn't run in background. Difficult time taking input and providing output, but possible.
   top &: Doesn't run in background. Updates slower than usual.
3. Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Z can help recover from such a situation. If the actuall Linux shell starts to get issues, typing in reset clears everything up.
4. That check is there in the event there is no process to wait for after receieving a signal.
5. See 3000shell.c code.
6. See 3000shell.c code.
7. After line 243 is deleted, the shell terminates every time you run something in the background.
8. Replacing calls to find_env with getenv makes no difference to the interface. You still see the prompt as 'student $' and the binary paths generated for commands are the same.
