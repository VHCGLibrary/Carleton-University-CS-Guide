        Arch
        Ubuntu**
        Debian
        Gentoo
2. Which of the following operations are permitted for an unprivileged user?
        Making a hard link to a file owned by root
        Making a symbolic link to a file owned by root**
        Making a character device file (with mknod)
        Mounting a USB stick on /mnt
        None of the above
3. Suppose you are running bc in a Linux terminal and press CTRL-C during its execution. Which of the following is TRUE?
        The kernel sends SIGSTOP to the terminal and causes bc to pause.
        Highlighted text gets copied to the clipboard on Linux.
        bc sends SIGTERM to itself and exits.
        bc sends SIGINT to itself and exits.
        None of the above**
4. Bashreadline can be used to observe
        commands given to bash when entered in a terminal**
        commands given to bash from sourced scripts
        commands given to any program on the system via a terminal
        A and B
        A, B, and C
5. The call b.attach_uretprobe() in bashreadline needs root access in order to succeed. Why does it need such privileges?
        It is directly modifying files owned by root.
        It is binding a privileged UNIX domain socket.
        It is accessing memory in an unsafe manner.
        It is loading code into the kernel.**
        All of the above
6. When the producer receives a SIGUSR1 signal in 3000pc, it immediately responds by
        printing a message to standard out
        changes the prod_waiting flag
        wakes up the producer
        All of the above
        None of the above**
7. Increasing the queue size in 3000pc will
        make the consumer send more signals
        make the producer sleep less frequently**
        make the producer produce faster
        make the consumer consume faster
        All of the above
8. An implementation of a semaphore tests the value of the semaphore and changes it if the semaphore is available. What makes it hard to write a good semaphore implementation?
        semaphore operations should be fast
        semaphores work on shared data
        testing and setting a variable are normally separate instructions
        CPU cores have separate caches
        All of the above**
9. Which of the following is true about "shared" in 3000pc?
        It is fixed sized**
        Its size varies depending upon how many words are stored in it
        It is allocated in the standard process heap
        It is never cached
        All of the above
10. Which of the following could be used to generate truly random numbers?
        Seeding rand() in C with the current time
        Gathering input from a webcam
        Using an algorithm that generates numbers using a cryptographic hash
        Calculating digits of a transcendental number such as pi
        None of the above**(Incorrect)
11. The ssh command on Linux opens all of these files EXCEPT
        /etc/ld.so.cache
        /etc/services
        /dev/random**
        /dev/urandom
        /etc/passwd
12. With what uid and euid values is it possible for a process to (successfully) call seteuid? Note that seteuid is a privileged system call that regular user processes cannot invoke.
        A process is running with uid=0 and euid=0
        A process is running with uid=1000 and euid=0
        A process is running with uid=1000 and euid=1000
        A process is running with uid=0 and euid=1000
        All of the above**
13. A process's execution can be paused, allowing another process to run on the CPU, when it
        makes a system call
        copies a string
        reads a file
        All of the above**
        None of the above
14. Increasing a process's priority (lowering its niceness value)
        increases the likelihood of it running when it needs CPU time**
        gives it a guaranteed share of CPU time
        makes it send signal faster
        All of the above
        None of the above
15. Assuming that the attacker has already set up the TOCTTOU attack in advance, when must the attacker's code run relative to the code in safe_write() in 3000log-write?
        Before the call to access()
        After the call to access(), before the open()**
        After the call to open(), before the write()
        After the call to write()
        None of the above
