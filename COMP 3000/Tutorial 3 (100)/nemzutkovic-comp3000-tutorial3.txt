COMP 3000: Tutorial 3

1. Regular Text File: Shows file name, inode #, file size, and the frequency of the letter 'a' in the file.
   Directory: Shows directory path, inode #, and the directory size.
   Symbolic Link: Shows symbolic link name, inode # and file size.
   Device File: Shows path of device file, inode # and file size.
2. See 3000test.c code. 
   For a symbolic link, it shows a different inode #/file size and no longer displays the frequency of the letter 'a' in the file. The rest is the same.
3. See 3000test.c code.
4. From my testing, all files and directories can be ran with 3000test. 
   The only possible change is if you remove read permissions, you can no longer get the 'a' count from files.
   Removed ALL permissions from a file, changed user/group ownership to root, and can still run the file with 3000test.
5. Using a 1GB test file, and having the sleep(3) run every 200-millionth count, you can tell with top that the memory usage increases steadily.
   Here is a sample increase in memory usage (%): 9.5 -> 19.1 -> 28.6 -> 31.7 -> 38.3 -> 47.8
