COMP 3000: Tutorial 6

1. You can 'make clean': remove all files except the c file and Makefile, and 'make zip': creates a zip file with the c file and Makefile.
2. You can write 4096 bytes to /dev/remember. PAGE_SIZE determines the limit, which is 4096.
3. Data is being allocated in init_saved_data() when the call to alloc_pages() is made.
   Data is being deallocated in free_saved_data() when the call to __free_pages() is made.
4. You can increase the amount of data that /dev/remember stores by increasing saved_data_order.
- saved_data_order = 0...means you are allocating 1 Page.
- saved_data_order = 1...means you are allocating 2 Pages.
- saved_data_order = 2...means you are allocating 4 Pages.
5. The kernel uses virtual address spaces for its own data structures.
6. We are copying data from user space to kernel space with copy_from_user().
   We are copying data from kernel space to user space with copy_to_user().
7. The remember module has a new file operation: .write that calls remember_write(). This is a key new addition.
   Along with this addition, the remember module has init_saved_data(), free_saved_data() and remember_write().
