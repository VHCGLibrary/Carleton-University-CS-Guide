COMP 3000: Tutorial 5

A simple kernel module:
1. Downloading and compilation.
2. If you type in 'more /var/log/kern.log' yo uwill notice the hello message that was recorded.
3. Two ways of doing this:
- 'more /proc/modules' will display the kernel modules.
- lsmod will show the kernel modules and the simple module should be at the very top.
4. 'sudo rmmod simple.ko' should remove the kernel module. The simple.ko module should no longer appear in /proc/modules and when you type lsmod.

A character device kernel module:
1. Downloading and compilation.
2. The message kernel message generated by the ones module is: comp3000: Ones device registered using major 243.
   The following files were generated in /sys/devices/virtual/comp3000/ones: dev, /power (contains 9 files), subsystem (sym link), uevent.
3. Outputs 1 presumbly infinitely. You can limit the output through modifying the code (adding a boolean) or using less /dev/ones.
4. See ones.c code.
   
Listing processes from a module:
1. Downloading and compilation.
2. current is a struct, specifically a 'task_struct' struct. Need to check the kernel source code under the task_tgid_vnr function for this.
3. See newgetpid.c code, and run 'ls /dev' to check.
4. See newgetpid.c code, and run 'cat /dev/describe' to check.
