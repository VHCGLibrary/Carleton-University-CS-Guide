COMP 3000: Tutorial 9

Running 3000log-write
- "Kilroy was here" shows up in testfile. 
- Yes, it was owned by root, but student managed to write over the contents of the file.
- Unsure, keeps generating a random date.

Setting up the exploit environment: Just setup instructions

Running the exploit: After MANY attempts and changing the for loop to 'seq 1 30' it changed to 'payload the victim file'.

Other Tasks & Questions:
- See 3000log-write.c code.
- Shorter delays, theoretically would be better because your attempting to deliver the payload to the victim file more often.
- No, because if you use hard links, the inode numbers would be different, so you wouldn't be writing to the same file.
- The attack won't work with just appending to the file.
- Using the BCC tool syscount you can see the higher than normal system calls, which should raise a red flag.
- It slows the system down, but it doesn't affect the race.
