1. Open the Project3Dto2D.sln file in Visual Studio.
2. Change the build configuration to `Release` and have the architecture set to `x64`.
3. Click `Local Windows Debugger` and 1 window will appear showing the results of running the program (screenshot attached).

**Please note: 
- I do not know if this code will run on a macOS/Linux environment or on other architectures othan than x64.
- You will also have to alter the project properties to include/link your OpenCV library, because our paths are different.
