OpenCV Version Used: 3.2

1. Open the HybridImage.sln file in Visual Studio.
2. Change the build configuration to `Release` and have the architecture set to `x64`.
3. Click `Local Windows Debugger` and 4 windows will appear showing `cat2.png` and `littledog.png` in these various states:
- Cat Greyscale Image
- Dog Greyscale Image
- Cat Gaussian Blur Image
- Dog Gaussian Blur Image

**Please note: 
- I could not finish this question in time. Things starting to go wrong when colour came into the picture.
- I do not know if this code will run on a macOS/Linux environment or on other architectures othan than x64.
- You will also have to alter the project properties to include/link your OpenCV library, because our paths are different.
