<p class="segment-header">Description:</p>
<p>The purpose of this tutorial is for you to show us some of the Assignment #2 code you have written. As most of you will have been working on the assignment you should have some of the requirements completed by the time of your tutorial (for some the tutorial will be after the assignment due date). Also this will gives us a change to see your intended solution with you there to answer questions about your approach. We are also interested in observing first hand the variety of solutions you have all come up with.</p>
<p class="red">IMPORTANT: This tutorial is meant as a homework assignment and for you to demonstrate your results at your tutorial session. You will not be able to complete it if you only start when you come to the tutorial. You will need to learn some basics of javascript on your own and come up with a strategy to solve the problems.</p>
<p>To get credit for the tutorial you must complete, or make significant progress on, the exercise problems provided and demonstrate your results to the tutorial TA before you leave the tutorial.<br />

<p class="segment-header"><span class="black-bold">Demonstration of your Assignment #2 Code</span></p>
<p>For this tutoiral you are required to demonstrate to the TA's some of your assignment #2 code. Ideally this should be demonstrated with clients running on different machines in the lab, but it will be OK to have different browsers open on the same machine. The TA's want to get a first-hand look at some of the variety of solutions you have come up with and maybe spot some choice ones.</p>
<p>The TA's will ask you some random questions about your code. As part of the tutorial exericse you need to be able to explain how any given part of your code is working.</p>
<p>As a rough guideline you need to show your code satisfies at least <span class="red">three</span> of the following numbered requirements from the assignment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>R3.2) To be allowed to control items a user must register, or sign in, or request control of a certain item. This could be done by the user typing their name and some indication of what they want to control as appropriate for your app. </p>
<p>R3.3) The app should have certain things that a user can move either with the mouse or keyboard strokes. To move an item, however, the user must first be given control of that item or set of items. For example, two air hocket paddles may initially be unclaimed but if a user requests that they &quot;be&quot; one of the paddles the server should allow them to control that paddle, but not the paddle of the opposing player. This might be done as follows. A player might type &quot;red&quot; into a text field and then click &quot;assign&quot; which will assign them to control the red paddle. This could be as simple as the server letting the client javascript know what items that client can move.</p>
<p>R3.4) The app should make it clear visually what items are currently being controlled by users and what items are available for users to request. For example, once a user is assigned to control of an air hockey paddle the appearance of that paddle might change -maybe have their name on it or have a certain colour or look.</p>
<p>R3.5) The client should only be allowed to move the items that the server has assigned them control over. If the client requests other items to control the server might add them, or instead drop control permissions of the previous item. It depends on your situation.</p>
<p>R3.6) If a client, with  control premissions, moves an item that motion should appear in real-time accross all browser windows connected to the app. Note we are expecting you will co-ordinate the different clients through the server. This can be based on the clients simply using a timer and polling the server for updated status and locations or it could be based on the server having websocket connections with various clients. The choice is yours. Polling is easier to build but has more message traffic.</p>
<p>R3.7) The app should involve and show motion. That is, items moving around under user control and perhaps some moving around by themselves. If you are building a collaborative &quot;fridge poetry&quot; app the only motion might come from users dragging words around. If it is an air hockey game then the puck is traveling by itself with the players each moving their paddle. Games face a challenge because collisions should appear the same in all browser windows and the motion might create a lot of message traffic. Don' t worry if you motion is more &quot;choppy&quot; than you might have hoped for. We are looking for proof of concept here. If real-time is very important to your app the a web socket solution would likely be better than a polling solution.</p>
