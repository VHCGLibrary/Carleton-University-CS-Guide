# CS-Code

Contains all my work done during my computer science undergrad. Each directory is represented as the course code in the form of COMP XXXX.
Each directory will have it's own README file that will outline the professor, time course was taken, programming language(s) used and any other instructions.

## Purpose

To help current and future students get inspiration for their assignments and tutorials. Copying is something I wouldn't recommend if you want to learn.

## Prerequisites

Each course README will outline its' own prerequisites.

## Compiling & Running

Each course will also outline it's own compiling and running procedures.
