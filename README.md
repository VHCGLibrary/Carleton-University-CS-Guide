# Carleton University CS Guide

Contains all my work done during my computer science undergrad program (2017-2020) @ [Carleton University](https://carleton.ca/). Each directory is represented as the course code in the form of COMP XXXX. Each directory will have it's own README file that will outline the professor, term course was taken, programming language(s) used and any other information or instructions. Each course directory has subdirectories that contain assignments, tutorials and any other useful material. Each of these subdirectories denote the (grade) received for that assignment or tutorial - that way, you know if it's worth taking a look at or not.

## Purpose
To help current and future students get inspiration for their assignments and tutorials. Copying is not advised.

## Prerequisites
Each course will outline its' own prerequisites.

## Compiling & Running
Each course will also outline its' own compiling and running procedures.

## Other
If there is anything you think I should add, remove, or change, feel free to email me at nem@zutkovic.com! Good luck!
